### An app created to help gamers find their perfect duo to play some games!

You are going to enter the app, search for the game you want to play, and you are going to see posts from all the people searching for a partner to game up!<br>
If you don't find any, you can make your own post and wait for a notification if somenone tries to connect with you!

This is a whole functional app made to work natively on mobile and on the web. Along with, all the servers and APIs were made from the ground up to provide stable conexions and acces to the right data.
